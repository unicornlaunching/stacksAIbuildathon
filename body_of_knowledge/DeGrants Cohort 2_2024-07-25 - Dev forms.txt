How can I swap or move my token on Stacks? Or I want to receive a SIP-010 token on a new account to increase privacy. How can I use the token without transferring STX from my old account to the new account? For users who do not have stx on their account, we want to offer an open source solution that allows them to pay transaction fees in other tokens than STX. This service works through so-called sponsored transactions. It can be integrated with different dApps and wallets.",,"Project Focus and Impact
The project is infrastructure that can be used by different dApps and wallets. It removes barriers for new users to enter the Stacks ecosystem. 

Target Audience and Strategy
The project targets developer of dApps and wallets. We will reach out individually first and try to integrate TX2 with two dApps and 1 wallet. With the experience from these integrations, we will produce better public documentation.

Project Activities and Outputs
Development of backend: A (serverless) service that accepts sponsored txs and signs them after validation
Development of web app: A simple app that allows to manage a sponsorship service
Documentation: Details how to integrate sponsorship services into dApps and wallets.
Community outreach: Discussions about and integration with dApps and wallets.","Milestone 1 (mid June) completed: Proof of concept with sendstx.com and NOT token sponsorship
Milestone 2 (mid July): Landing page
Milestone 3 (mid August): Management app for sponsorship service
Milestone 4 (mid September): Integration with one or two dApps (when fast blocks are live)
Milestone 5 (mid October): Integration with Smart Wallet (or alternative wallet)

Note that the timeline is stretched to fit the Nakamoto release.",2000,"$2,006","$ 1k Development of landing page
$ 2k Development of management app
$ 5k Integration with dApps and wallets
$ 2k Content creation <-- looking for support for this",The project receives fees from users (in other tokens than STX). The project can help projects to integrate sponsorship service for a fee. Apps using TX2 have an interest to keep the service alive. There are also ideas to implement a subscription model (using Smart Wallet)," Yes, for POC see https://github.com/friedger/stacks-not-sponsoring/ and https://github.com/friedger/stacks-send-many","Long time Stacks OG with developer experience (sendstx.com, Ryder handles, catamaranswaps, ..)","Project Challenges and Risk Mitigation

    ""Pay fees in sBTC"" might be part of the consensus rules and a sponsorship service is not required any more for BTC. See https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc-docs/issues/27. However, TX2 still makes sense for other tokens like meme coins or wrapped USD.

    Copycats who offer the same service, and we run out of business. However, competition is good for innovation.

    The service receives spam txs that are paid for but fail, and no compensation is received. However, we can improve the verification of received txs and even simulate the execution before sponsoring. 

    Stacks 3.0 does not launch. However, then we all will pivot anyway, I guess.


Obstacles and Implementation Barriers
The handling of nonces is challenging for sponsored transaction. However, Stacks 3.0 will bring fast blocks reducing the challenges because nonces are process more quickly. TX2 can also use more than one sponsorship address, e.g. one per request.

The integration of TX2 with sendstx.com showed that it works. However, the verification of received txs might take more effort than we think. The TX2 will have different verification modules to address challenges for different tx types.

Market Competition and Impact
There is no public sponsorship service available now. There are running some bots in the background that execute txs in the name of users (e.g. bridges).
TX2 will lower the barrier to enter the Stacks ecosystem.","https://github.com/friedger/stacks-not-sponsoring

This standard will enable developers to create interoperable payment solutions, fostering innovation and adoption across both ecosystems. By providing a unified approach to payment requests, we'll simplify the development process, enhance user experience, and strengthen the connection between Bitcoin and Stacks networks. The project will include comprehensive documentation, reference implementations, and developer tools to encourage widespread adoption.",,"#### Project Focus and Impact:
Our project focuses on creating a standardized payment request system connecting Bitcoin and Stacks. Quantitatively, we aim to have at least 5 projects adopt our standard within 6 months of completion. Qualitatively, we expect to simplify cross-chain payments and foster greater interoperability between Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystems.

#### Target Audience and Strategy:
We target developers building payment solutions on both Bitcoin and Stacks. Our strategy involves creating clear, developer-friendly documentation, providing sample implementations, and engaging with the developer community through workshops and hackathons.

#### Project Activities and Outputs:
Activities include developing the standard specification, creating reference implementations, and producing comprehensive documentation. Outputs will be the published standard, open-source code repositories, and developer resources.","Milestone 1 (Month 2): Draft specification completed, 30% of reference implementation done.

Challenges include potential resistance to a new standard and technical complexities in cross-chain interactions. We'll mitigate these through extensive community engagement and rigorous testing and by leaning on existing, well-known payment standards from other areas.

#### Obstacles and Implementation Barriers:
We may face challenges in achieving consensus on the standard. We'll overcome this by actively involving key stakeholders from both Bitcoin and Stacks communities in the development process. In addition, the viability of sBTC as a payment option depends on the successful implementation of the Nakamoto and sBTC hardforks.

This grant aims to develop a fully automated fuzzer, guided by LLMs to overcome the limitations of static analysis and detect novel and business logic vulnerabilities.","Gecko addresses the lack of security tooling in the Stacks ecosystem, where the only solution is manual audits that are expensive, infrequent and often incomplete. Gecko currently offers an OSS automated security solution using static analysis. This proposal aims to expand on Gecko by implementing dynamic analysis testing using a fully automated fuzzer guided by LLMs. This enhancement will overcome the limitations of static analysis, providing deeper code coverage and the ability to detect novel and business logic vulnerabilities.  Users simply provide either the deployed smart contract address or code, and Gecko Fuzz autonomously generates exploits and remediations when vulnerabilities are found, eliminating the need for manually writing invariants or specifying input generation strategies. This upgrade will ensure Clarity contracts are secured at the speed and scale necessary for the growing Stacks ecosystem.","A gecko is a small lizard that crawls around and eats bugs; similarly, Gecko Fuzz is a fuzzer that crawls through your code to find bugs. It lowers the barrier for security testing of Clarity contracts, making regular and thorough security assessments accessible to both individual developers and large teams. Gecko Fuzz is a novel tool that combines formal verification (concolic execution) with fuzzing algorithms guided by dataflow patterns and LLM comparisons to find on-chain smart contract vulnerabilities with no manual effort. Users do not need to write invariants or specify input generation strategies, as Gecko autonomously generates exploits when vulnerabilities are found.","- Project Focus and Impact:
        - Gecko will be the first security tool in the Stacks ecosystem, addressing the lack of scalable security solutions.
        - It will contain a database of vulnerabilities and remediations, offering real-life examples to guide developers in best practices for Clarity contract development.
        - Gecko will reduce pre-deployment security barriers, helping developers understand attack surfaces and focus audits, thereby lowering costs and improving coverage.
- Target Audience and Strategy:
        - Targeting Stacks developers through community engagement, social media channels and partnerships.
- Project Activities:
        - Full-Time Development: Funding will support dedicated development resources to enhance Gecko.
        - Research and Development: Innovating with new approaches to dynamic analysis security testing for Clarity contracts.
- Outputs and Broader Impact:
        - Providing a comprehensive automated testing solution that includes code coverage, vulnerability location, and proof of concept exploits with remediations.
        - Expanding Gecko's capability to detect new types of vulnerabilities, broadening its applicability beyond DeFi.
        - Promoting an open-source, AI-driven framework that encourages continuous improvement and collaboration within the community.
        - Offering a scalable, affordable security solution that integrates into CI/CD pipelines, making regular and thorough security assessments accessible to both small developers and large teams.","- Proof of Concept Development: (1 Month FTE) $2,500

    - Integrate analysis of ASTs and implement a preprocessor that queries the LLMs to guide the corpus of the Fuzzer.",5000,"$1,787","$4.5K for FTE development costs
$500 for infrastructure costs","As fuzzing performance scales linearly with the amount of CPU cores used and most users wont have the compute to continually fuzz with several cores or run a 70B parameter LLM locally, we will host a fuzzing as a service SaaS (with a free tier) using the open sourced Gecko Fuzzer, to enable users who want to easily and quickly fuzz test any contract.  The SaaS will also provide a web GUI interface that allows the users to quickly and easily see the results in a visual way. This is a way that both benefits users and allows Gecko to grow sustainably. ",Yes,"JJ is a security engineer with 5 years experience and a background in vulnerability research. JJ started his career working for the UK Intelligence and has previously worked at Binance and contracted security work for big tech companies. Now working as a smart contract auditor JJ also develops automated auditing tools using AI, fuzzing and formal verification. A x2 blackhat scholar and ranked in the top 500 globally in CTF's (competitive hacking), JJ was inspired to start building automated web3 tools after reading countless surface-level useless audit reports and discovering ways AI and automation can increase a hackers workflow.  JJ's commitment to the Clarity ecosystem is evident through my success in various hackathons, including winning first place at Consensus for developing the first static analyser for Clarity within three days. This achievement not only highlights his technical proficiency but also demonstrates his ability to deliver high-quality results under time pressure.","The project's business viability and need are clear, with the only barrier being technological feasibility.

6/28/2024 16:37:56,ludovic@galabru.com,Txtx: Introducing Smart Contract Runbooks,Infrastructure,"Smart Contract Runbooks turn the stress, pain and complexity of Smart Contract Infrastructure management into a secure, robust and scalable developer experience.","We can break down the Web3 development process in 4 main phases: Development, Testing, Deployment, and Operation.  To handle deployments and operations, developers are writing custom scripts that are encoding, signing and sending contract deployments and contract calls on chain by manupulating private keys manually (very insecure). Most of the time they are undocumented, unaudited, unmaintained and fragile.  With Txtx, we are introducing Smart Contract Runbooks. A Runbook is a recipe designed to make sequences of blockchain interactions (like contract deployments or contract calls) reproducible and robust. With our solution, developers can build their infrastructure for running their operations in matter of minutes / hours, instead of days / weeks. We introduce a declarative programming language designed for writing Smart Contract Runbooks and we maintain open source developer tooling (IDE extension, CLI tool, runbook registry, etc), helping developers work efficiently with Runbooks.",,"Securing Operations
Runbooks replace traditional one-off JavaScript files for smart contract deployment and interaction, mitigating the security risk of handling sensitive private keys directly by providing a more secure, structured, and user-friendly approach.

Communication between Organizations
Smart Contract Runbooks standardize processes, reducing the learning curve and facilitating seamless communication and collaboration between companies. Their composability allows organizations to share and reuse workflows, ensuring consistency and promoting a shared understanding, enhancing onboarding and scalability.

Time to market
Txtx allows developers to bring their products to market much faster. They can focus on refining their smart contracts and ensuring they meet user needs, rather than getting bogged down in the intricacies of contract integration.","The project is approaching an alpha stage and completely de-risked. Our goal is to open our beta end of July (in Nashville), and have a release candidate by end of August.",6000,,"We will be hiring a design studio, to improve the UI/UX of our product - turning it from acceptable to great, which is key for a tool that teams will be using on a daily / weekly basis.","The core of the product will be open source, and usable by developers on their machine, offline if they want to.
