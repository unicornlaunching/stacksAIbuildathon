## 🚀 1. **Redirecting Funding and Development Priorities**

### 🛠️ 1.1 **From "Cindy" to Security Champions**

> The initial plan was to use a **$1,300 grant** to develop "Cindy the Community Copilot," an AI tool aimed at assisting projects with their go-to-market strategies.

The **Charisma BTC exploit** (loss: **$300,000-$400,000**) triggered a unanimous decision to shift the focus to **AI-powered security tools**.

---

### ⚠️ 1.2 **Urgent Need for Enhanced Security**

The **Charisma hack** exposed ecosystem **vulnerabilities**, underscoring the need for **robust security** to build **trust** and attract **liquidity**—especially with **Nakamoto** and **SBTC** upgrades looming.

---

## 🔑 2. **Addressing Key Security Vulnerabilities**

### 💰 2.1 **Lack of Affordable Auditing**

Traditional **audits** are costly, leaving many projects **vulnerable**.  
Developing **AI-powered security** tools aims to offer **cost-effective** solutions for projects of all sizes.

---

### 🏰 2.2 **Governance Attacks and Privilege Escalation**

The **Charisma hack** revealed **DAO structure weaknesses**—the "dungeon master" admin contract is particularly susceptible.  
New **security measures** will address privileged role vulnerabilities.

---

### 🧠 2.3 **Inherited Vulnerabilities & Lack of Automated Checks**

> **Charisma’s code**, forked from **Executor DAO**, carried over **known vulnerabilities**—showing the risks of **inherited code**.

The lack of **automated checks** enabled the attacker to bypass detection.

---

## 🤖 3. **Proposed AI-Powered Security Solutions**

### 🔍 3.1 **AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning**

Training **AI models** on datasets of known vulnerabilities to detect **patterns** in new code—helping developers address issues **proactively**.

---

### 🔐 3.2 **AI-Driven Auditing Tool**

Automating the audit process by identifying **deviations from best practices** and flagging **risky code**—making audits **more efficient** and **accessible**.

---

### ⚙️ 3.3 **Exploit Pattern Recognition**

Creating an **open-source repository** of exploits and vulnerabilities to train **AI models** on attack patterns and predict **future exploits**.

---

## 🌍 4. **Embracing Open Source and Collaboration**

### 🤝 4.1 **Open-Source Development**

Building security tools as **open source** promotes **collaboration**, **transparency**, and the adoption of **best practices** across the Stacks ecosystem.

---

### 👨‍🔧 4.2 **Collaboration with Existing Initiatives**

Working with the **"Orange Hat" group** and consulting with **Zet Zeus** will avoid **duplication** of effort and bring **unified security** to the Stacks ecosystem.

---

## 🚧 5. **Challenges and the Path Forward**

To build **effective AI-powered security tools**, comprehensive datasets on vulnerabilities and secure coding practices are essential.  
The success of these tools hinges on the **quality** and **breadth** of the training data.

Additionally, the community must increase **security awareness** and **education**.  
By developing **accessible tools**, the group hopes to create a **more secure** and **resilient** ecosystem.

---

## 💡 **6. Suggestions from CASPIAQ**

- [ ] **PHASE ONE**: Run Stacks Node (Stacks Blockchain API Node, not a Signer Node)
- [ ] **PHASE TWO**: Populate Database with Mempool Transactions
- [ ] **PHASE THREE**: Build Malicious Pattern Database
- [ ] **PHASE FOUR**: Compare Malicious Pattern Database to Mempool Transactions
- [ ] **PHASE FIVE**: Assign Surface Attack Area Score and Other Scores to Each Transaction
- [ ] **PHASE SIX**: Create User Interface to Display Unconfirmed Transactions with Scores
