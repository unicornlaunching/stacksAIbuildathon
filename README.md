# **Stacks Ecosystem Security Shift**

This document analyzes the key decisions and discussions surrounding the shift in focus from an AI-powered community copilot to prioritizing security tools within the Stacks ecosystem.

---

## 1. **Redirecting Funding and Development Priorities**

### 1.1 **From "Cindy" to Security Champions**

> The initial plan was to use a $1,300 grant to develop "Cindy the Community Copilot," an AI tool aimed at assisting projects with their go-to-market strategies.

The recent **Charisma BTC exploit**, resulting in a loss of **$300,000-$400,000**, triggered a change in priorities.  
The group **unanimously decided** to redirect the grant towards developing **AI-powered security and auditing tools** for the Stacks ecosystem.

---

### 1.2 **Urgent Need for Enhanced Security**

The **Charisma hack** highlighted the **vulnerability** of projects within the ecosystem.  
Robust security measures are crucial for building **trust** and attracting **liquidity**, especially with upcoming upgrades like **Nakamoto** and **SBTC**.

---

## 2. **Addressing Key Security Vulnerabilities**

### 2.1 **Lack of Affordable Auditing**

Traditional audits are **high-cost**, posing a significant barrier and leaving many projects **vulnerable**.  
Developing **AI-powered security scanning** and **auditing tools** aims to provide more **accessible** and **cost-effective** solutions.

---

### 2.2 **Governance Attacks and Privilege Escalation**

The **Charisma hack** exposed vulnerabilities in **DAO structures** and the "**dungeon master**" admin contract.  
Improved **security measures** around privileged roles are critical to prevent **similar exploits**.

---

### 2.3 **Inherited Vulnerabilities and Lack of Automated Checks**

> **Charisma's code**, forked from **Executor DAO**, contained known vulnerabilities, highlighting the risks of **inheriting code**.

The absence of **automated checks** or **multi-signature systems** allowed the attacker to operate **undetected**.

---

## 3. **Proposed AI-Powered Security Solutions**

### 3.1 **AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning**

Training **AI models** on datasets of known vulnerabilities and exploits to identify **similar patterns** in new code.  
This will enable developers to **proactively address security flaws** during development.

---

### 3.2 **AI-Driven Auditing Tool**

Automating parts of the auditing process, such as identifying **deviations from best practices** or **flagging risky code**.  
This makes audits more **efficient** and **accessible**, particularly for projects with **limited resources**.

---

### 3.3 **Exploit Pattern Recognition**

Creating an **open-source repository** of past exploits and vulnerabilities.  
Training **AI models** to recognize **patterns** and predict **future exploits** by analyzing past attack methodologies.

---

## 4. **Embracing Open Source and Collaboration**

### 4.1 **Open-Source Development**

Developing security tools as **open source** to foster **collaboration**, **transparency**, and wider adoption of **best practices**.

---

### 4.2 **Collaboration with Existing Initiatives**

Coordinating with initiatives like the **"Orange Hat" group** and consulting with **Zet Zeus** to leverage **existing expertise** and avoid **duplication**.  
Building a **unified and effective** security effort within the **Stacks ecosystem**.

---

## 5. **Challenges and the Path Forward**

Building effective **AI-powered security tools** requires access to **comprehensive, well-labeled datasets** of vulnerabilities, exploits, and secure coding practices.  
The accuracy and effectiveness of these tools depend on the **quality and scope** of training data.

Addressing the need for **increased security awareness** and **education** within the community.  
By developing **accessible security tools**, fostering collaboration, and promoting best practices, the group aims to create a more **secure** and **resilient** Stacks ecosystem.
