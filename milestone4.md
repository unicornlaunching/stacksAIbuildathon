### How might we improve the Syndicate AI Buildathons on Stacks?
- Group buildathons are great at helping The Stacks Ecosystem identify what products are needed on the ground.
- One-on-one AI Buildathons are the most effective way to turn key Founders in the stacks ecosystem into developers following Group Buildathons.
- Creatives like artists are very interested in learning how to code and just need access to mentors that can help them when they get stuck.
- There is an opportunity for Business Buildathons where Founders in Web2 who already have businesses are introduced to the stacks ecosystem of product and service catalogs.
